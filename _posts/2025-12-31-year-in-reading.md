### [The Forgetters]() by Greg Sarris

The Forgetters is a masterclass in storytelling. Sarris sets up a wonderful frame of two crow women talking about telling stories interwoven with the stories themselves. The folk tales themselves are wonderfully rich. Highly recommended.

### [Perpetual Law]() by Mario Bellatin

### [What A Fish Looks Like]() by Syr Hyati Beker

For me What a Fish Looks Like is a love letter to queer community, queer spaces, and the potentiality of transformation. The world as we know it is ending, more quickly in the story than IRL, but who knows when we’ll catch up?

The recently-split Seb and Jay pass a book of fairy tales back and forth. It accumulates their notes and ephemera from events their daily lives navigating the apocalypse and making their plans for remaining and/or for escape. The places and characters invade the stories in the book just as the stories invade their lives. Seriously, watch out for the encroaching carnivorous vines!

I was struck by the necessity of collectivity for survival, and of an undoing of narratives that have not served us as a species. Transformation is inevitable. You really see, feel, and experience what an anti-colonial “happily ever after” can be.

### [Open Throat]() Henry Hoke

The rich language and the point of view of the mountain lion make this novel work for me. You really get a sense of the mountain lion's isolation in what should be its native habitat. It is both fun and sad to be a voyeur from this perspective. The fire in the canyon really presages the terror that happened in LA in January 2025. If I had one minor critique is that it takes punches at an highly visible and easily mocked segment of the LA population.

### Books for Alexander Chee's "How to write an essay collection" seminar

#### [Thin Skin]() by Jenn Shapland

In this collection of essays, Jenn Shapland shines her light into the darkest caverns of America's heart.
She addresses the colonization and poisoning the native lands now called New Mexico, the indidous impacts of whiteness and whte supremacy, the appeal of "woo," the endless war on women's bodies, and more.
The topics are challeging and the essays are long, but Shapland uses section breaks, interspliced interviews, and other formal elements to keep the pace moving.
I related to her attraction to Pema Chodron and the practice of tonglen: it gives a sense of hope to her testimony regarding sos much horror.

#### [Brown Neon]() by Raquel Gutiérrez

What I loved most about this book was the lesbian, queer, and punk history of the 90s and 2000s. In this era of queer erasure, it remains a remarkable document. The tension between the butch lesbians and the trans men, the politics of the softball leagues in East LA, the performance art in San Antonio: all of it seethes with drama. Gutiérrez's toughness is tempered by her vulnerablility. She lets us hear the voice of her self-doubt, to witness her awe for the desert southwest, and feel her profound love for those close to her.
