#### [Thin Skin]() by Jenn Shapland

In this collection of essays, Jenn Shapland shines her light into the darkest caverns of America's heart.
She addresses the colonization and poisoning the native lands now called New Mexico, the indidous impacts of whiteness and whte supremacy, the appeal of "woo," the endless war on women's bodies, and more.
The topics are challeging and the essays are long, but Shapland uses section breaks, interspliced interviews, and other formal elements to keep the pace moving.
I related to her attraction to Pema Chodron and the practice of tonglen: it gives a sense of hope to her testimony regarding sos much horror.
