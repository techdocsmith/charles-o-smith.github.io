### [Model Home](https://bookshop.org/a/100115/9781250397591) by Rivers Solomon

I read "Model Home" to be a horror story emerging from decades of gaslighting the Maxwell family experienced in a wealty Texas suburb. Solomon lays bare the characters' heartache and terror alongside their deep and complicated love for one another.

### [El Ghourabaa](https://metonymypress.com/products/el-ghourabaa-queer-trans-oddities/) Eli Tareq El Bechelany-Lynch and Samia Marshy editors

I loved this "Queer and Trans collection of Oddities." The editors have collected a fine set of poems and stories by Arab queer folk. I could stand to reread the whole collection, but I especially loved Tareq El Bechelany-Lynch's story "The Spa" that wonderfully captured the fear, desire, and potential queer joy of the locker room.

### [Ghost Roots](https://bookshop.org/a/100115/9781324065852) by Pemi Aguda

I must admit being drawn to the striking, at first cute, then noticably shocking cover of this book. The stories that haunt me from this collection are "24, Alhaji Williams Street" and "The Dusk Market." In the former, boys are dying of a mysterious fever throught the neighborhood and the narrator must decide what to do. The latter concerns an enchanted market

### [The Forgetters]() by Greg Sarris

The Forgetters is a masterclass in storytelling. Sarris sets up a wonderful frame of two crow women talking about telling stories interwoven with the stories themselves. The folk tales themselves are wonderfully rich. The forgetters takes a high place in my list of favorite books andon my personal fairytale canon. Highly recommended.

### Hooking UP by M. J. Arcangelini

This is a great chapbook of poems that explore queer cruising culture in vivid detail with ache tenderness.

### [What A Fish Looks Like]() by Syr Hyati Beker

For me What a Fish Looks Like is a love letter to queer community, queer spaces, and the potentiality of transformation. The world as we know it is ending, more quickly in the story than IRL, but who knows when we’ll catch up?

The recently-split Seb and Jay pass a book of fairy tales back and forth. It accumulates their notes and ephemera from events their daily lives navigating the apocalypse and making their plans for remaining and/or for escape. The places and characters invade the stories in the book just as the stories invade their lives. Seriously, watch out for the encroaching carnivorous vines!

I was struck by the necessity of collectivity for survival, and of an undoing of narratives that have not served us as a species. Transformation is inevitable. You really see, feel, and experience what an anti-colonial “happily ever after” can be.

### [Open Throat]() Henry Hoke

The rich language and the point of view of the mountain lion make this novel work for me. You really get a sense of the mountain lion's isolation in what should be its native habitat. It is both fun and sad to be a voyeur from this perspective. The fire in the canyon really presages the terror that happened in LA in January 2025. If I had one minor critique is that it takes punches at an highly visible and easily mocked segment of the LA population.

### [Thin Skin]() by Jenn Shapland

In this collection of essays, Jenn Shapland shines her light into the darkest caverns of America's heart.
She addresses the colonization and poisoning the native lands now called New Mexico, the indidous impacts of whiteness and whte supremacy, the appeal of "woo," the endless war on women's bodies, and more.
The topics are challeging and the essays are long, but Shapland uses section breaks, interspliced interviews, and other formal elements to keep the pace moving.
I related to her attraction to Pema Chodron and the practice of tonglen: it gives a sense of hope to her testimony regarding so much horror.

### [Brown Neon]() by Raquel Gutiérrez

What I loved most about this book was the lesbian, queer, and punk history of the 90s and 2000s. In this era of queer erasure, it remains a remarkable document. The tension between the butch lesbians and the trans men, the politics of the softball leagues in East LA, the performance art in San Antonio: all of it seethes with drama. Gutiérrez's toughness is tempered by her vulnerablility. She lets us hear the voice of her self-doubt, to witness her awe for the desert southwest, and feel her profound love for those close to her.

### Audiobooks

I'm listening to more audiobooks, so want to share those here, too:

#### Babel by R. F. Kuang

This was a wonderful story and well read. I loved magical aspect of the story set against the colonialist history of a "sacred" learning institution. The characters are complex
