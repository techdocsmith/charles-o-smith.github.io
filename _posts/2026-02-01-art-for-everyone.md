I'm thrilled to announce that my drawing "Resist!" is traveling to Healdsburg for the [Art for Everyone](https://www.renacharlesgallery.com/artforeveryone2026) exhibit at [Rena Charles Gallery](https://www.renacharlesgallery.com/).
The show is up from February 1 until February 28, 2026.

About the show, curator Rena Charles says, "ART FOR EVERYONE is a community exhibition exhibition celebrating the shared joy of creativity..."
